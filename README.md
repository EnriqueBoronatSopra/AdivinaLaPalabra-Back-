##Adivina la palabra

Guess the Word is a game similar to Wordle, in which the player has to guess a secret five-letter word in five attempts. The game gives the player clues about whether the letters they have entered are correct, incorrect, or in the wrong position.

This repository contains the code for the game's back-end, developed using Java and Spring Boot. The back-end is responsible for generating the secret words, validating player inputs, and sending responses to the front-end.
